Hello, I had the same issue and needed to manually add the pic-as toolchain because I didn't install MPLAB to its default location.
To do so, you need to go in Tools->Options->Embedded->Build Tools->Add and set ???\xc8\v2.31\pic-as\bin (where ??? is the installation path of the xc8 compiler).
After that, pic-as appeared as expected in the project configuration



git pull origin Bertrand-test:Alex-TB

From anywhere, type in the command line to run the code
/home/aheuchamps/Matjes-GITHUB/Matjes/Matjes/bin/Matjes



If you want to delete all the TB_solution.dat file
you could go to a direction below which all of them are and do
find . -name TB_solution_r.dat -delete



If want to replace "TB_write_solution_r .true." by
"TB_solution_r .false." in input
sed -i  "s/TB_write_solution_r .true./TB_write_solution_r .false./" input 



And if they are all in subdirectories
sed -i "s/TB_write_solution_r .true./TB_write_solution_r F/" */input



if you want to find out were all your disk quota went you can use
du -sh * | sort -h
to show the sorted size of subdirectories and files



To copy all the .gnu files in the directory t5d-5
into all the other directories
echo ./*/ | xargs -n 1 cp t5d-5/*.gnu



To run a gnuplot file called "BANDS-and-DOS.gnu"
gnuplot "BANDS-and-DOS.gnu"
To convert the .eps output to some .pdf
epstopdf BANDS-and-DOS.eps



To use things properly:
1) create a Git remote repository (online, only do it once)
2) clone it where it has to be (only do it once)
3) git add ~~what_has_to_be_put_on_Github~~ (each time something is modified)
4) git commit -m "message_for_the_commit" (each time something is modified)
5) git remote add origin ~~url_of_the_repository~~ (only do it once)
6) git push origin ~~name_of_local_branch~~ (each time something is modified)
